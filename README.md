Deduce is an automated proof checker meant for use in education. The
intended audience is students with (roughly) the following background
knowledge and skills:

* Basic programming skills in a mainstream language such as Java,
  Python, or C++, as one would learn in the introductory computer
  science course at a university.
* Some exposure to logic, as one would learn in a course on Discrete
  Mathematics (aka. Discrete Structures).

The primary goal of Deduce is to support the teaching of proofs of
correctness of pure functional programs. The reason for the focus on
pure functional programs is because (1) those proofs are much more
straightforward to write than proofs of correctness of imperative
programs, so the students are more likely to succeed at them, and (2)
the technology for automatically checking those proofs is well
understood, so it's straightforward to build and maintain the Deduce
proof checker.
