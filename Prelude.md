# Prelude

This is the first in what I hope to be a sequence of blog posts about
(1) data structures and algorithms, (2) an approach to constructing
correct code, and (3) achieving a deeper understanding of testing,
logic, and proof, all of which are needed for constructing correct
code. These blog posts take a functional programming approach to data
structures and algorithms because, in that setting, there are software
tools that make sure that our proofs about correctness are themselves
correct! In particular, these posts will use the Deduce language for
writing programs, testing them, and proving theorems.  Unlike most
functional languages and proof assistants, the syntax of Deduce is
meant to be easy to learn for people familiar with languages such as
Java or Python. The `README.md` file in the Deduce github repository
provides an introduction to Deduce. We recommend reading that first.

These blog posts will cover a limited number of the data structures
and algorithms, as the pace will be slower due to the increased focus
on correctness. The rough plan is to cover the following topics.
