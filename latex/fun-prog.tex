\section{Introduction}

The Deduce proof assistant includes two languages, the Deduce
programming language and the Deduce proof language. This booklet
introduces the Deduce programming language. This language is designed
so that it is straightforward to prove the correctness of programs
written in Deduce. Primarily this means that Deduce is a ``pure''
language; it does not support side effecting operations such as
writing to memory through a pointer.

\section{Import}

The \texttt{import} feature of Deduce makes available the contents of
another Deduce file in the current file. For example, the following
imports Deduce's library for natural numbers from the file
\texttt{Nat.pf}.

\begin{verbatim}
import Nat
\end{verbatim}

\section{Definitions}

The \texttt{define} feature of Deduce associates a name with a value.
The following definitions associate the name \texttt{five} with the
natural number \texttt{5}, and the name \texttt{six} with the natural
number \texttt{6}.

\begin{verbatim}
    define five = 2 + 3
    define six : Nat = 1 + five
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Optionally, the type can be specified after the name,
following a colon.  In the above, \texttt{six} holds a natural number,
so its type is \texttt{Nat}.

\section{Printing Values}

You can ask Deduce to print a value to standard output using the
\texttt{print} statement.

\begin{verbatim}
    print five
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The output is \texttt{5}.

\section{Functions ($\lambda$)}

Functions are created with a $\lambda$ expression.  Their syntax
starts with $\lambda$, followed by parameter names, then the body of
the function enclosed in braces.  For example, the following defines a
function for computing the area of a rectangle.

\begin{verbatim}
    define area : fn Nat,Nat -> Nat = λ h, w { h * w }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The type of a function starts with \texttt{fn}, followed by
the parameter types, then \texttt{->}, and finally the return type.

To call a function, apply it to the appropriate number and type of
arguments.

\begin{verbatim}
    print area(3, 4)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The output is \texttt{12}.

A $\lambda$ expression may only appear in a context where Deduce knows
what it's type should be. The following produces an error because the
following \texttt{define} does not include a type annotation.

\begin{verbatim}
    define area = λ h, w { h * w }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Deduce prints the following error message.

\begin{verbatim}
    cannot synthesize a type for λh,w{h * w}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Unions and Switch}
\label{sec:union}

The \texttt{union} feature of Deduce defines a type whose values are
created by one or more constructors.  A union definition specifies a
name for the union type and its body specifies the name of each
constructor and its parameter types. For example, we define the
following union to represent a linked-list of natural numbers.

\begin{verbatim}
    union NatList {
      nil
      cons(Nat, NatList)
    }
\end{verbatim}

We construct values of type \texttt{NatList} using the constructors
\texttt{nil} and \texttt{cons}. To create a linked-list whose elements
are \texttt{1} and \texttt{2}, write:

\begin{verbatim}
    define NL12 = cons(1, cons(2, nil))
\end{verbatim}

Unions may be recursive: a constructor may include a parameter type
that is the union type, e.g., the \texttt{NatList} parameter of
\texttt{cons}. Unions may be generic: one can parameterize a union
with one or more type parameters. For example, we generalize linked
lists to any element types as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
    union List<T> {
      empty
      node(T, List<T>)
    }
\end{verbatim}

Constructing values of a generic union looks the same as for a regular
union. Deduce figures out the type for \texttt{T} from the types of
the constructor arguments.

\begin{verbatim}
    define L12 = node(1, node(2, empty))
\end{verbatim}

\pagebreak

You can branch on a value of union type using \texttt{switch}. For
example, the following function returns the first element of a
\texttt{NatList}.

\begin{verbatim}
    import Option

    define front : fn NatList -> Option<Nat> =
      λ ls { 
        switch ls {
          case nil { none }
          case cons(x, ls') { just(x) }
        }
      }
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The output of 
\begin{verbatim}
    print front(NL12)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent is \texttt{just(1)}.

The \texttt{switch} compares the discriminated value with the
constructor pattern of each \texttt{case} and when it finds a match,
it initializes the pattern variables from the parts of the
discriminated value and then evaluates the branch associated with the
\texttt{case}.

If you forget a \texttt{case} in a \texttt{switch}, Deduce will tell
you. For example, if you try the following:
\begin{verbatim}
    define broken_front : fn NatList -> Option<Nat> =
      λ ls { switch ls { case nil { none } } }
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Deduce responds with
\begin{verbatim}
    this switch is missing a case for: cons(Nat,NatList)
\end{verbatim}


\section{Natural Numbers}

Natural numbers are not a built-in type in Deduce but instead they are
defined as a \texttt{union} type:

\begin{verbatim}
    union Nat {
      zero
      suc(Nat)
    }
\end{verbatim}

The file \texttt{Nat.pf} includes the above definition together with
some operations on natural numbers and theorems about them.  The
numerals \texttt{0}, \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, etc. are shorthand for
the natural numbers \texttt{zero}, \texttt{suc(zero)},
\texttt{suc(suc(zero))}, etc.

\section{Booleans, Conditional Expressions, and Assert}

Deduce includes the values \texttt{true} and \texttt{false} of type
\texttt{bool} and the usual boolean operations such as \texttt{and},
\texttt{or}, and \texttt{not}.  Deduce also provides an if-then-else
expression that branches on the value of a boolean. For example, the
following if-then-else expression is evaluates to \texttt{7}.

\begin{verbatim}
    print (if true then 7 else 5+6)
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{assert} statement evaluates an expression and reports an
error if the result is \texttt{false}. For example, the following
\texttt{assert} does nothing because the expression evaluates to
\texttt{true}.

\begin{verbatim}
    assert (if true then 7 else 5+6) = 7
\end{verbatim}

\section{Recursive Functions}

Recursive functions in Deduce are somewhat special to make sure they
always terminate.

\begin{itemize}
\item The first parameter of the function must be a union.
\item The function definition must include a clause for every
  constructor in the union.
\item The first argument of every recursive call must be a sub-part of
  the current constructor of the union.
\end{itemize}

A recursive function begins with the \texttt{function} keyword,
followed by the name of the function, then the parameters types and
the return type. Finally, the function body includes one clause for
every constructor of the union. Each clause is an equation whose
left-hand side is the function applied to a constructor pattern and
whose right-hand side is the value of the function for that case.

For example, here's the definition of a \texttt{len} function for
lists of natural numbers.

\begin{verbatim}
    function len(NatList) -> Nat {
      len(nil) = 0
      len(cons(n, next)) = 1 + len(next)
    }
\end{verbatim}

There are two clauses in the body. The clause for \texttt{nil} says
that its length is \texttt{0}.  The clause for \texttt{cons} says that
its length is one more than the length of the rest of the linked list.
Deduce approves of the recursive call \texttt{len(next)} because
\texttt{next} is part of \texttt{cons(n, next)}.

Recursive functions may have more than one parameter but pattern
matching is only supported for the first parameter. For example, here
is a function \texttt{app} that combines two linked lists.

\begin{verbatim}
    function app(NatList, NatList) -> NatList {
      app(nil, ys) = ys
      app(cons(n, xs), ys) = cons(n, app(xs, ys))
    }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Generic Functions}

Deduce supports generic functions, so we can generalize \texttt{len}
to work on lists with any element type by defining the following
\texttt{length} function.

\begin{verbatim}
    function length<E>(List<E>) -> Nat {
      length(empty) = 0
      length(node(n, next)) = suc(length(next))
    }
\end{verbatim}

Generic functions that are not recursive can be defined using a
combination of \texttt{define}, \texttt{generic}, and $\lambda$.

\begin{verbatim}
    define head : < T > fn List<T> -> Option<T> =
      generic T { λ ls { 
          switch ls {
            case empty { none }
            case node(x, ls') { just(x) }
          }
        }
      }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The type of a generic function, such as \texttt{head},
starts with its type parameters surrounded by \texttt{<} and \texttt{>}.

\section{Higher-order Functions}

Functions may be passed as parameters to a function and they may be
returned from a function. For example, the following function checks
whether every element of a list satisfies a predicate.

\begin{verbatim}
function all_elements<T>(List<T>, fn T->bool)->bool {
  all_elements(empty, P) = true
  all_elements(node(x, xs'), P) = 
    P(x) and all_elements(xs', P)
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Pairs}

Pairs are defined as a \texttt{union} type:

\begin{verbatim}
    union Pair<T,U> {
      pair(T,U)
    }
\end{verbatim}

The file \texttt{Pair.pf} includes the above definition and several
operations on pairs, such as \texttt{first} and \texttt{second}.

\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Sum the Elements in a List}

Define a function named \texttt{sum} that adds up all the elements of a \texttt{List<Nat>}.

\begin{verbatim}
define L13 = node(1, node(2, node(3, empty)))
assert sum(L13) = 6
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Inner Product}

Define a function named \texttt{dot} that computes the inner product of two \texttt{List<Nat>}.

\begin{verbatim}
define L46 = node(4, node(5, node(6, empty)))
assert dot(L13,L46) = 32
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Last Element in a List}

Define a generic function named \texttt{last} that returns the last element
of a \texttt{List<E>}, if there is one. The return type should be \texttt{Option<E>}.
(\texttt{Option} is defined in the file \texttt{Option.pf}.)

\begin{verbatim}
assert last(L13) = just(3)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Remove Elements from a List}

Define a generic function named \texttt{remove\_if} that removes elements
from a list if satisfy a predicate. So \texttt{remove\_if} should have two
parameters: (1) a \texttt{List<E>} and (2) a function whose parameter is \texttt{E} 
and whose return type is \texttt{bool}.

\begin{verbatim}
assert remove_if(L13, λx {x ≤ 1}) 
       = node(2, node(3, empty))
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Non-empty Lists and Average}

Define a \texttt{union} named \texttt{NEList} for non-empty list.
Design the alternatives in the \texttt{union} to make it impossible to
create an empty list.

Define a function named \texttt{average} that computes the mean of a
non-empty list and check that it works on a few inputs.
Note that the second parameter of the division operator \texttt{/} 
is of type \texttt{Pos}, which is defined in \texttt{Nat.pf}.
